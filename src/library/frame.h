 * - Receiving data from libTAS and sending data to it
 * - Dumping audio/video
 *
 * It is mainly called during a screen refresh (drawFB == true),
 * but can be called also by the timer when we need to advance time to avoid a
 * game softlock (game expect time to pass).
 * Parameter restore_screen tells if we must redraw the original screen at the
 * end of the frame boundary. Useful for draw commands that only update part
 * of the screen.
